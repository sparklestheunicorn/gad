# Welcome! This is a React client for https://debatemap.app.

It was created as a volunteer project for [The Society Library](https://www.societylibrary.org/) and bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Design and workflow principles:

- Mobile first
- Github workflow (create feature/cool-new-branch-name, push, review, squash, merge)
- Semantic HTML and accessibility is expected

# Recommended plugins and environment settings:

- SPACES 4 LIFE (2 of them). See next point to not worry about this.
- For code uniformity, please install the Prettier extension for your code editor.

# Getting started

First, you will need to reate a .env file. See the included .env.example. You should be able to make a renamed copy of this
and be good to go.

Then you can:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the demo app, CORVID CONVO, a conversation about crows, ravens, magpies, and their awesome cousins. Its data
is populated to represent features that have been implemented.

You can make your own debate map by visiting https://debatemap.app
